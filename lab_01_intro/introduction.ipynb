Among the most obvious examples, almost everyone has heard of ChatGPT, which is based on large language models (LLMs – Large Language Models), or has used Google Search, which also relies on language models to better understand user queries. However, neural networks are applied in many other fields, such as image recognition, audio analysis, computer games, and even medicine, where they assist in diagnosing diseases. Due to their versatility and rapid development, it is worth learning the basics of how neural networks work and how they can be applied in various domains.\n","\n","<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vision-agh/DNN-Course-media/refs/heads/main/lab1_introduction/figures/google.png\" alt=\"Google AI Response\" width=\"600\"/>\n","\n","\n","The aim of these course is to introduce the fundamental concepts related to neural networks, to learn how to use popular libraries for building and training them, such as PyTorch, and to understand the process of machine learning.\n","\n","During the course, we will explore some of the most popular neural network architectures, such as:\n","- MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron)\n","- CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)\n","- RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks)\n","- GNN (Graph Neural Networks)\n","- SNN (Spiking Neural Networks)\n","- Transformers for natural language processing (NLP) as well as computer vision (CV)\n","- Generative models (GANs, Diffusion Models)\n","- and others.\n","\n","We will also cover different machine learning techniques, such as supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, along with methods like knowledge distillation and transfer learning.\n","\n","As you can see, the scope of material is very broad, and it is impossible to cover everything within a single semester.

The division into Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and Generative AI (GAI) is often confusing, but it can be clarified using the diagram below (source: [link](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Unraveling_AI_Complexity_-_A_Comparative_View_of_AI,_Machine_Learning,_Deep_Learning,_and_Generative_AI.png)):\n","\n","<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vision-agh/DNN-Course-media/refs/heads/main/lab1_introduction/figures/comparison.png\" alt=\"AI, ML, DL, GAI\" width=\"600\"/>\n","\n","Deep neural networks consist of many interconnected layers. Neurons are organized into layers: the input layer receives the data, hidden layers process it, and the output layer generates the final prediction. Three main elements are essential for training a neural network:\n","\n","1. **Data** – Neural networks learn from datasets, which provide information about patterns and dependencies.\n","2. **Architecture** – The structure of the network, i.e. the number of layers, the number of neurons in each layer, type of layers and how they are connected. Different architectures are better suited for different types of tasks.\n","3. **Learning algorithm** – The method by which the network adjusts its weights and biases based on training data to minimize prediction error. The most commonly used approach is backpropagation, combined with optimizers such as Adam or Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).\n","\n","Based on the type of training data, machine learning can be divided into three main categories:\n","- **Supervised Learning** – The network learns from labeled data, where each input is paired with a known output (label or value). The goal is to predict correct outputs for unseen data.\n","- **Unsupervised Learning** – The network learns from unlabeled data, without known outputs. The goal is to discover hidden patterns or structures, such as clustering or dimensionality reduction.\n","- **Reinforcement Learning** – The network learns through interaction with an environment (simulation), receiving rewards or penalties based on its actions. The goal is to learn optimal decision-making strategies within that environment.\n","\n","For now, without going into too much detail, I encourage you to explore the following resources:\n","\n","- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/supervised-vs-reinforcement-vs-unsupervised/\n","- https://medium.com/@bensalemh300/supervised-vs-unsupervised-vs-reinforcement-learning-a3e7bcf1dd23\n","- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"0bce876e","metadata":{"id":"0bce876e"},"source":["### Envirenment setup\n","\n","During the course, we will primarily use Python and the following libraries:\n","\n","* **PyTorch** ([https://pytorch.org/](https://pytorch.org/)) – a widely used library for building and training neural networks, popular in both academia and industry.\n","* **PyTorch Geometric** ([https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)) – an extension of PyTorch designed for working with graphs and graph neural networks.\n","* **snnTorch** ([https://snntorch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://snntorch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)) – a library for building and training spiking neural networks (SNNs).\n","* **PyTorch Lightning** ([https://www.pytorchlightning.ai/](https://www.pytorchlightning.ai/)) – a high-level interface for PyTorch that simplifies model training and experiment management. We will start using it later in the course.\n","* **Weights & Biases (W&B)** ([https://wandb.ai/](https://wandb.ai/)) – a tool for experiment tracking, result visualization, and machine learning project management. We will use it for logging our experiments, and it integrates seamlessly with PyTorch Lightning.\n","\n","Additionally, we will rely on standard data analysis and visualization libraries, such as **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **OpenCV**, and others.\n","The exercises have been prepared and tested with GPU acceleration using **Jupyter Notebook** and a **Conda virtual environment**.

In that case, you can copy the Jupyter Notebook code into Colab and run it there.
